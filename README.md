# Homework_Tracker
Desktop application to track your homework. The project inspiration came from the normal website that I use to track my homework assignments not letting me add more assignments. So I said, "I'll just make my own". 
This project has been spread out over the course of about a week and served as an introduction for me to Tkinter and Python in general. I have experience coding, mostly in Java, and decided that it was time to try Python. The app also served as a simple intro to Python CSV files, reading and writing to files, and the syntax as a whole. I enjoyed making this and look forward to revising and polishing my Tkinter skills.
