# Homework_Tracker
Desktop application to track your homework. The project inspiration came from the normal website that I use to track my homework assignments not letting me add more assignments. So I said, "I'll just make my own". 
This project has been spread out over the course of about a week and served as an introduction for me to tkinter and python in general. I had experience coding, mostly in Java, and wanted to try Python. I also used this
project as an intro to CSV files, reading and writing to files, and python syntax as a whole. I enjoyed making this and look forward to revising and polishing my tkinter skills.
